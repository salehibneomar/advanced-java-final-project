Description:

For this final project/assignment I chose the Online Dating App topic.

Tools used:
----------
RESTapi = Java Spring Boot
Database = MySQL
UI Framework = Bootstrap 4.5
Frontend handled by = PHP 7 (cURL and Session)

Why did not I use any Java based frontend framework?

Reasons:
I don't know any good and easy java based web ui frameworks, 
yes there is Vaadin but the resources on Vaadin seems very limited to me,
and I will take much time to learn Vaadin to get some work done.

That's why decided to use PHP to process the frontend though PHP is a backend language.


#The app is not final it's just a demo to show how I actually planned and what I wanted to do.
